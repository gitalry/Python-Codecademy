#Define a function compute_bill that takes one argument food as input.
#In the function, create a variable total with an initial value of zero.
#For each item in the food list, add the price of that item to total.
#Finally, return the total.
#Ignore whether or not the item you're billing for is in stock.
#Note that your function should work for any food list.
